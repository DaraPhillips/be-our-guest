Be Our Guest App
Have you ever attended a wedding where the only people you know are the newlyweds? And on the big day, they are so busy that they wouldn‚Äôt have time to talk with you for more than 5 minutes?
You looked around and regretted that you didn‚Äôt ask the hosts about who else you know is attending, or to introduce you to a few other guests beforehand. Alone and awkward, you dragged your feet to the bar‚Ä¶

‚Ññ1: The Challenge
Don‚Äôt let lack-of-communication ruin a happy day! People tend to have a better time when they know what‚Äôs going on and are surrounded by familiar faces. The miserable day for that lonely guest can be turned into a joyful and memorable experience with proper communication beforehand with the wedding hosts and among other guests!

Problem Definition
To start off, research was done online to understand current common user behaviour. Then the problem was further defined as:
 
WHAT
For this challenge with time constraints, you are required to design web application using Material Design Guidelines.
WHO
Both wedding hosts and guests are users of this product. The primary focus of the design comes from the problem domain i.e., from guest‚Äôs perspective, thus you are required to focus on guest experience for this project.
WHEN
The app can be used ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, ‚Äúduring‚Äù, ‚Äúafter‚Äù the wedding day. Your focus for this challenge is on the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù stage.

‚Ññ2: User Research
With better problem definition, primary research was conducted with people who attended at least one wedding in the past year (this time frame is to ensure they have relatively fresh memory).
Questions
‚Ä¢	How did the newlyweds provide the wedding information?
‚Ä¢	Did you have additional communication?
‚Ä¢	What did you talk about and when?
‚Ä¢	What tool did you use to communicate?
‚Ä¢	Did you feel you are always in the know?
‚Ä¢	What are the frustrations (if any) you felt in the process?

some quotes

Key Pain Points
1.	It‚Äôs messy and hard to sync conversations jumping among platforms;
2.	It‚Äôs difficult, if not impossible, to see guest list and familiarize with other guests beforehand.
The Pain Points provided a validation of the design concept.
‚Ññ3: Brainstorm & Ideation
Job-To-Be-Done Framework
 
Design Principles
1.	The product should be a single source of truth for both wedding information and chats;
2.	All wedding guests should have access to the guest list and are encouraged to acquaint other guests;
3.	The product should provide streamlined & intuitive experience, with clean & friendly interface.
User Flow

 
‚Ññ4: Design Execution
Overall, the design should do two things: 1) Provide wedding information in one place; 2) Encourage user to communicate with other guests.
Home Screen: See image below
The goal is to Reduce Cognitive Load by limiting the choices on the interface and displaying the choices in groups.
Most urgent task ‚ÄúRSVP‚Äù owns primary position.
Once user has RSVP‚Äôd, you should continue to use the same design to highlight most important information ‚ÄúCountdown‚Äù and the content we want to promote ‚ÄúGuestbook‚Äù.
 
Figure 1Initial homepage design
The App has a working title of ‚ÄúBe our guest‚Äù.

The completed design should include (once the invite has been RSVP‚Äôd and accepted):
‚Ä¢	See a ‚Äúcountdown‚Äù to the big day. From here the user can click on the Guestbook.
‚Ä¢	Once in the Guestbook, there should be 3 activities that the user can select from:
o	Guests ‚Äì shows all guests
o	Posts ‚Äì general post from any guest and/or the hosts
o	Chats ‚Äì specific chats with a single guest or groups of guests

‚Ä¢	The guest‚Äôs facility is where a guest can:
o	See all the guests who have accepted an invite
ÔÇß	The user should be able to see the profile of a guest.  The profile should tell the user about the guest.  How they met the hosts
o	When the table settings have been published, the user should see which table they will be at and which other guests are allocated to that table also.
‚Ä¢	Posts 
o	Hosts and guests can compose public posts for announcements or requests.  All guests can view or comment.
o	Hosts can keep certain posts pinned to the Top position.
‚Ä¢	Chats/Private Messaging
o	An individual should be able to chat (private message) another individual (if they are open to chatting)
o	When the table settings have been published, a group chat will automatically be set up and the user will be added to the appropriate chat group. 
While in any of the activities (Guest, Posts & Chats), Users can also look up the profile of each guest and see information about the guest like: short bit of information about them, a paragraph on how they met/know the hosts; their location and whether they are happy to chat. If happy to chat a chat icon should be active and the user needs only to click on it.  If they do not wish to chat the chat icon will be inactive.

‚Ññ5: Test Execution
Use the scenario below to do user testing. Design additional user-test cases.

User Scenario - Emily:

User: Emily, a close friend of the bride.
Background: Emily has received a wedding invitation via the Be Our Guest App and wants to respond to it. She's also curious to see if her friend, Sarah, has accepted the invitation and wants to post a congratulatory message to the couple.
Tasks and Goals:
1.	Accepting the Invitation:
‚Ä¢	Task: Emily opens the Be Our Guest App and is notified about her invitations.
‚Ä¢	Goal: The task assesses the app‚Äôs ability to clearly present invitations and the ease with which a user can respond. It checks the intuitiveness of the RSVP feature.
2.	Checking Friend's RSVP Status:
‚Ä¢	Task: After accepting, Emily searches for Sarah‚Äôs name in the guest list to see if she has responded to her invitation.
‚Ä¢	Goal: This task evaluates the functionality of the guest list feature in the app, focusing on how easily a user can find and view the RSVP status of other guests.
3.	Posting a Congratulations Message:
‚Ä¢	Task: Emily navigates to the "Posts" section and creates a congratulatory post, tagging the couple.
‚Ä¢	Goal: The aim is to test the posting feature‚Äôs user-friendliness and how effectively users can interact with others, including tagging and sharing content.
